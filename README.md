- Input loan amount, interest rate, and loan term.
- Display the calculated loan details, including the total amount to be paid and the interest to be paid.
- Visualize the loan details using a bar graph.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
- Angular CLI: You need the Angular CLI to run and build the project. You can install it using npm.

## Installation

   ```bash
   cd loan-calculator-app
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the JSON server to simulate a backend:

   ```bash
   npm run start-json-server
   ```
2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

3. Open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) to access the loan calculator application.

4. Use the application to input loan details, select a loan type, and click the "Simulator" button to calculate the loan payments.

## Development

The application's source code is organized into components, services, and styles. Here is an overview of the project structure:

- **Components**: The application has the following components:
  - `app-home`: Represents the home page.
  - `app-loan-calculator`: Contains the loan calculation form and results.
  - `app-navbar`: The navigation bar component.
  - `app-footer`: The footer component.
  - `app-graph-bar`: A reusable component for displaying bar graphs.

- **Services**: The `LoanCalculatorService` handles loan simulations and communicates with the backend API (not included in this project).

- **Styles**: The application uses SCSS for styling, and styles are organized in separate component-specific CSS/SCSS files.

- **Models**: The `Graph` model defines the structure of data for the bar graph.
